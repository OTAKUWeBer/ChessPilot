</p>

## Features

* **FEN Extraction**: Detects the board position from your screen using [Zai-Kun's Chess Pieces Detection](https://github.com/Zai-Kun/2d-chess-pieces-detection).
* **Local Model Inference**: Uses a local ONNX model to ensure fast, offline board recognition.
* **Maia (Lc0) Integration**: Analyzes the board and suggests a human-like move using the [Maia chess model](https://maiachess.com/) running through [Lc0](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0).
* **Auto Move Execution**: Automatically plays the best move on your screen.
* **Manual Play**: Use a **"Play Next Move"** button to control when the move is made.
* **Board Flipping**: Automatically flips the board if you're playing as Black.
* **Castling Support**: Tick checkboxes to indicate castling rights before each move.
* **Depth Control**: A slider lets you set Lc0‚Äôs search depth via nodes (default: \~8000 nodes).
* **Retry Mechanism**: Retries the move up to 3 times if it doesn't execute correctly.
* **ESC Key Functionality**: Press ESC to reselect playing color.
* **GUI Interface**: Uses Tkinter for a user-friendly, interactive experience.
* **Performance Optimized**: All processing is done locally‚Äîno external API calls.

## Download

Get the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/OTAKUWeBer/ChessPilot/releases/latest/).

### Required Downloads (Place These in the Project Folder)

1. **Chess Detection Model**
   Download the ONNX model from:
   [Download ONNX Model](https://github.com/Zai-Kun/2d-chess-pieces-detection/releases/download/v0.0.4/chess_detectionv0.0.4.onnx)

2. **Lc0 Engine (Leela Chess Zero)**
   Download the latest version of Lc0 for your platform:
   [Download Lc0](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/releases)
   
   > ‚öôÔ∏è **Note:** The ONNX runtime may require the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable on Windows. Download the latest supported version from the official Microsoft site: [Visual C++ Redistributable Downloads](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

3. **Maia Weights for Lc0 (ONNX)**
   Download a Maia weights file in ONNX format (e.g. `maia-1100.onnx`) from:
   [Download Maia Weights](https://maiachess.com/#downloads)

> üóÇÔ∏è **Important:** Do **not** rename the files. Just place the ONNX model, Lc0 binary, and Maia weight file directly inside the `ChessPilot` directory (same folder as `main.py`). The script will automatically detect and use them.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

* **Python 3.10+**
* **Python Packages**:

  * `mss`
  * `Pillow`
  * `pyautogui`
  * `onnxruntime`
  * `numpy`
  * `tkinter`
  * `pywin32`
  * `colorama`
  * `python-chess`

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### If `tkinter` is Missing

Tkinter is usually bundled with Python on Windows and macOS, but if you're on Linux or using a minimal Python build, you may need to install it manually:

* **Ubuntu / Debian:**

  ```bash
  sudo apt install python3-tk
  ```

* **Arch Linux:**

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S tk
  ```

* **Fedora:**

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
  ```

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OTAKUWeBer/ChessPilot.git
   cd ChessPilot
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add Required Files:**

   * Place the downloaded ONNX model (`chess_detectionv0.0.4.onnx`)
   * The `lc0` binary appropriate for your OS
   * And a Maia `.onnx` weights file (e.g., `maia-1100.onnx`)
     into the `ChessPilot` folder (same directory as `main.py`).

## Platform Notes

### Linux Users

Install Lc0 via your package manager or from the GitHub releases:

```bash
# Arch Linux
paru -S lc0

# Or build/install manually for full ONNX support
```

#### Wayland Users (Hyprland, Sway)

You will need additional tools for screenshots and screen size detection:

```bash
sudo pacman -S grim wayland-utils
```

---

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Choose Your Color:**

   * Select **White** or **Black**.
   * Press **ESC** to reselect.

3. **Enable Castling (If Applicable):**

   * Tick **Kingside** or **Queenside** before each move if you still retain castling rights.

4. **Set Move Depth (Optional):**

   * Adjust the slider to change the number of nodes Lc0 will search.
   * Higher values improve accuracy but slow down move calculation.

5. **Play Modes:**

   * **Manual Mode**: Click **"Play Next Move"** for each move.
   * **Auto Mode**: Enable **Auto Play** to let the script make your next move automatically.

6. **Retry System:**

   * The tool will retry move execution up to **3 times** if it fails initially.

7. **Tips for Accuracy:**

   * Use **100% zoom** in your browser or chess interface.
   * Keep the Tkinter window out of the way of the board.
   * Keep your board square and aligned.
