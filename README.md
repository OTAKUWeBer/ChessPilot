## Features

- **Automatic Board Flipping**: Automatically flips the board if youâ€™re playing as Black.
- **Stockfish Integration**: Uses the Stockfish chess engine to suggest the best move.
- **Auto Move Execution**: Automatically plays the best move suggested by Stockfish.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides a user-friendly interface instead of terminal-based interaction.
- **New Feature â€“ ESC Key**: Allows the user to go back and select the playing color again.
- **New Feature â€“ Castling Support**: Users can now indicate castling rights via a tick mark before each move.
- **New Feature â€“ Depth Slider**: Users can now choose the depth for Stockfish's analysis via a slider. **Note**: More depth means longer processing time. The default depth is set to 15, which is recommended for a good balance between speed and accuracy.

   ```

2. **Choose Your Color via the GUI:**
   - Click **White** if playing as White.
   - Click **Black** if playing as Black.

3. **Indicate Castling Rights:**
   - Before each move, tick the checkbox for **Kingside Castle** or **Queenside Castle**, if applicable.

4. **Choose Depth for Move:**
   - Use the slider to select the desired depth for Stockfish's analysis. **Note**: The higher the depth, the more time it will take for Stockfish to compute the best move. The default depth is set to **15**, which is suggested for optimal performance.

5. **Tips for Best Performance:**
   - Use 100% zoom for better accuracy in chessboard detection.
   - After selecting "Play next move," the script will:
     - Extract the FEN from the image.
     - Flip the board if playing as Black.
     - Retrieve the best move from Stockfish.
     - Automatically execute the move.
   - The best move will be displayed in the GUI.
   - For improved visibility, reposition the Tkinter window so the chessboard remains clear.
