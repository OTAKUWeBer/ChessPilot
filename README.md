* **Board Flipping**: Automatically flips the board if you're playing as Black.
* **Castling Support**: Tick checkboxes to indicate castling rights before each move.
* **Depth Control**: A slider lets you set Stockfish‚Äôs analysis depth (default: 15).
* **Retry Mechanism**: Retries the move up to 3 times if it doesn't execute correctly.
